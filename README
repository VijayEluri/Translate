general purpose command line utility for google languages services.  
items:
DONE: do translation in languages supported by google translate via api
DONE: do translation in language supported by google dictionary via scraping

DONE: verify special char support and limits (preferrede encoding utf-8) (sometimes not testable)
DONE: interface via command line
TODO: can do massive bulk lookup and save in "rosita" xml format
TODO: clean up the scraping part with some refactoring if possibile.
TODO: add note about the term of use of google language services

TODO added item: provide an automated build 
	tasks: create by hand a distribution zip containing the jar and a command line for bash and windows -> DONE
    task: create by hand a manifesto referencing all the libs and the main class 
	task: automate the zip creation in the ant file -> DONE


TODO added item: provide an installation tool
TODO added item: clean the lib dir from unused jars

issues: special chars in windows do not shows on console (will probably work in output to file version, using utf-8)
issues: somehow a log4j warning appears -> FIXED

issues:the -gDic option should not be called massively because it does not use any officially supported google api and google can block automated call to the service.

usage:

after a build is done (manually doing a jar of the builded sources and adding it and all on lib dir on classpath) an example of execution
is the following:


>java com.tonyxzt.language.Translator --gApi --oriLang=it --targetLang=en "ciao amico"
hello friend

>java com.tonyxzt.language.Translator --gDic --oriLang=it --targetLang=en ciao
bye-bye!, bye!, so long!, cheerio!, hello!, hi!, hallo!, hullo!,
